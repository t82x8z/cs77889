Questions Project 4. Curved Graphene
1.- a) What types of curvature can be present in a graphitic structure? Explain and show pictures with examples. (cite all sources. See New Journal of Physics, Terrones H and Terrones M., 2003).
b) How does curvature is related to the genus of a closed compact surface?
2.- a) In case of triply periodic graphene or Schwarzites how can the genus be found? Explain (cite all sources) and use the following structure to calculate the genus:

b) What is a triply periodic minimal surface an代 写Questions Project 4. Curved Graphene
代做程序编程语言d what is its relation to Schwarzites?
c) What electronic properties can be found in Schwarzites (cite all sources).
3.- Find the genus of the structures “a”, “b” and “c” put in the LMS as part of this project and draw an image of them using Vesta.
4.- Is it possible to get a closed compact graphenic structure (not periodic) with just heptagonal and hexagonal rings of carbon? Justify clearly your answer.
5.- Print using a 3-D printer structures “a” and “b”.
